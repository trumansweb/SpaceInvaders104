/**
 * An entity represents any element that appears in the game. The
 * entity is responsible for resolving collisions and movement
 * based on a set of properties defined either by subclass or externally.
 * 
 * Note that doubles are used for positions. This may seem strange
 * given that pixels locations are integers. However, using double means
 * that an entity can move a partial pixel. It doesn't of course mean that
 * they will be display half way through a pixel but allows us not lose
 * accuracy as we move.
